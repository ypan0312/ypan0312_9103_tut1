# Quiz 8 – Imaging and Coding Technique Research

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

One imaging technique that deeply inspires me is the real-time generative visual style used in *Hakanaï* (2013) by Adrien M & Claire B. The project projects dynamic, interactive lines and grid-like geometries that react to a dancer’s movements, constructing a live, immersive digital space. I aim to integrate a simplified form of this motion-responsive aesthetic into my assignment. The temporal and spatial fluidity of *Hakanaï* aligns with the assignment’s goal of responsive, screen-based interaction. Even though complex, this approach represents a compelling visual framework for designing emotionally engaging and computationally expressive experiences.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

While researching techniques to simulate the soft, organic motion found in Hakanaï, I discovered an explanation and example implementation of Perlin noise on a GitHub-hosted blog titled “Perlin Noise: A Procedural Generation Algorithm”. The article introduces how Perlin noise can be used to generate natural textures and motion patterns. Although I have not implemented the technique myself, I believe the illustrated logic and example could be adapted in p5.js to create smooth, flowing animations that visually resonate with Hakanaï's aesthetic.
